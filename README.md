School Canteen Assessment

I am going to create a canteen website that allows the user to buy multiple goods at once, and calculate the total cost.


"An ordering system for the School Canteen.  A GUI menu takes input from the operator (menu items are chosen from a series of options, including quantity) and interacts with an array of food items.  Each order has a space for entering the name associated with the order. The program stores orders in an array.  The program allows for take-away and calculates the final cost of the order.  The menu drives all aspects of the ordering system."



Program Details:

The school canteen has the following food:  
Sushi Roll pack - Starting with 5  
Hot dog and Chips - starting with 12  
Ham and Cheese Sandwiches - 4 in stock  

The user should be able to sell a food item one at a time, reducing the stock by one.   
The interface should notify the user if the food has been sold successfully.   
The interface should notify the user with an error message if the food has not been sold if there is not enough stock.  
The interface should display:  
The total food sold in a lunchtime.  
The current stock levels of all food items (at once). If the stock levels change at any point, the interface should update.  
The user should be able to restock a chosen food item.   
The user should be able to input how many of the food item is available. For example, restock Sushi Roll with 6 more.  
There is no limit to the amount of food it can hold.  
The program should display relevant error messages for appropriate situations.  
There could be extra functionality you add. 


Broken down versions:

ver 1.0 = Create a Python server
ver 1.1 = Create the index page in notepad++ (colour scheme)
ver 1.2 = Create header and the nav bar
ver 2.0 = Create a buy page that will contain the food set out in orderly fashion (hopefully with a picture)
ver 3.0 = Add values to the contents of the buying page (stock, cost)
ver 4.0 = Code the code so that when you press the buy button the stock will go down and and the cart price will go up, with a message that gets sent to the user saying it was successful or not
ver 5.0 = +stock page, set up the contents with their stock and add an add stock insert tab that allows the user to stock up as much as they want
ver 6.0 = add a credit card details page? and a reciept page
ver 7.0 = possiably for extra, make a page where you can add a food
